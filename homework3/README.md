This dataset contains terms of services list scraped from the website. Starting page: https://tosdr.org/

Data volume:

1. Name
There are 76 classificated websites and apps, some are famous some are not


2. Class
There are only 3 Class A: Kolab Now, DuckDuckGo and Seen This. And there is only 1 Class C: Google.

And 65 No Class Yet, Terms of Service Didn't Read (tosdr) said this is because they haven't sufficiently reviewed the terms yet, maybe tosdr need more time to finish the classification.

3. Comments
Every website or app has 1 comment, we can find the most apps (17 of 76) have a comment said:"You cannot delete your account". and 16 apps or websites have a problem "Terms may be changed any time at their discretion, without notice to the user".

It means this two problems are common in most of the apps and websites, should pay attention to this kind of problem and deal with the problem properly if they want to increase quality of their service.
